# Mock Server Project

Welcome to the Mock Server Project! This project is a simple Node.js server built with Express. It simulates JSON responses for two collections: **colleagues** and **clients**. You can retrieve and add data using GET and POST requests. This guide will help you understand how to set up, run, and test this project.

2. [Installation](#installation)
3. [Running the Server](#running-the-server)
4. [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints)
5. [Testing the API with Postman or Curl](#testing-the-api-with-postman-or-curl)
6. [Contributing](#contributing)

## What You Need

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime that runs the server. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Node.js package manager (comes with Node.js).
- **Postman** (optional but recommended): A tool to test APIs. [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   If you haven’t already, clone this repository to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mock-server-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd mock-server-project
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see a message like this:

```
Server is running on http://localhost:5000
```

This means your server is up and running on your computer.

## API Endpoints

Here are the available API endpoints you can use:

### Colleagues

- **GET /api/colleagues**: Retrieves a list of all colleagues.
  
  Example request:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/colleagues
  ```

  Example response:
  ```json
  [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "position": "Developer" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "position": "Designer" }
  ]
  ```

- **POST /api/colleagues**: Adds a new colleague and returns the new colleague's data.

  Example request:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/colleagues -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Charlie", "position": "Manager"}'
  ```

  Example response:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Charlie",
    "position": "Manager"
  }
  ```

### Clients

- **GET /api/clients**: Retrieves a list of all clients.
  
  Example request:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/clients
  ```

  Example response:
  ```json
  [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Client A", "industry": "Finance" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Client B", "industry": "Healthcare" }
  ]
  ```

- **POST /api/clients**: Adds a new client and returns the new client's data.

  Example request:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/clients -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Client C", "industry": "Technology"}'
  ```

  Example response:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Client C",
    "industry": "Technology"
  }
  ```

## Testing the API with Postman or Curl

You can use Postman or the `curl` command in your terminal to test the API.

### Testing with Curl

- **GET Request** to retrieve data:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/colleagues
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/clients
  ```

- **POST Request** to add new data:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/colleagues -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Charlie", "position": "Manager"}'
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/clients -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Client C", "industry": "Technology"}'
  ```

### Testing with Postman

1. **Download and Install Postman** if you haven’t already.
2. **Create a New Request**:
   - For GET requests: Choose GET, enter `http://localhost:5000/api/colleagues` or `http://localhost:5000/api/clients`, and click **Send**.
   - For POST requests: Choose POST, enter the appropriate URL, select **Body**, choose **raw** and **JSON** format, and enter the data you want to send.
3. **View the Response**: Postman will display the response from the server in the lower section.
